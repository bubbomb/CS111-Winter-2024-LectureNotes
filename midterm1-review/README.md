# Midterm Review

I recommend going through each of the files:

[classes](classes.py)

[make_dice](make_dice.py)

[someFUNction](someFUNction.py)


Take a pencil and paper like you would if you were going through the midterm. Try and figure out what the print statements would do and check your answers by running the file.

Hope this helps!
